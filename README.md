Vimtris
---
Tetris game built on [rainbow-ui](https://github.com/codewaterlabs/rainbow-ui), which is built on [reasongl](https://github.com/bsansouci/reasongl).
Uses vim keys, so the name. Was made to learn reasonml, while also maybe
getting a game to play and relax a little between programming sessions.
The "rainbow-ui" framework evolved from this.

Since it is built on reasongl, it is along the way to working as a native project, but currently there are web-specific code several places.

To install, I need to use ```yarn install```, then I use ```yarn build:web```.
